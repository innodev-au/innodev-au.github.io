## The Fascinator (used by ReDBox)

Forks created from [The Fascinator](https://sites.google.com/site/fascinatorhome/) and related plugins. The forks added functionality to allow greater integration with authorisation and authentication systems (namely LDAP role lookup and CAS single sign-on) and extended the CSV data import function. The added integration functionality was accepted and merged back into the main product.

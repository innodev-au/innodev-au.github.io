# Innodev Open Source Repositories

## For webMethods

[wmboost-data](https://github.com/innodev-au/wmboost-data): A free and open source Java library that makes it easier to access and manipulate documents in webMethods compared to coding directly with out-of-the-box classes like IData and IDataUtil. It can be used for either server or client-side code.

## Fascinator

Forks created from [The Fascinator](https://sites.google.com/site/fascinatorhome/) and related plugins. The forks added functionality to allow greater integration with authorisation and authentication systems (namely LDAP role lookup and CAS single sign-on) and extended the CSV data import function.
